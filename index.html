<h3>There are some conditions for receiving the service:</h3>

<p> The patient can save the complete personal information of the doctor before receiving the service. However, we verify the information of the doctors and allows them to provide services in our app only after verifying the information. But the patient can verify the BMDC ID of the doctor if he wants. We will not be held responsible if any kind of problem is encountered after verification by the patient.  Since we establish connection between the patient and the doctor, so there is no direct connection between them, so we will not be held responsible if there is any problem in provided service. But in case of any problem due to the provided service if the patient informs us, action will be taken against the doctor subject to proper evidence.  Since our app provides telemedicine service, We will never be considered as an emergency medical service provider.  We never provide formal diagnosis or treatment, we only connect the patient with the registered doctors. So here you can discuss your health problem with the doctor using the service medium and seek advice.  You can consult a registered doctor using the app but we will not be responsible for any physical problem or mutilation or loss of life due to that consultation.  We will not be held responsible for any problems with your fetus, your minor child if you consult a registered doctor using the app.  We will not be liable if the advice of the registered doctor of our app is applied to another person and if any kind of problem is encountered for that.  Since the doctor's consultation service is internet dependent and the service might be interrupted due to any problem related to the internet, we will not be held responsible for that.  Since we provide services with the help of internet and mobile devices, we will not be held responsible if any kind of service is disrupted due to the problem of the device.  Since you have to rely on internet and devices to receive the services of our app, many a times due to device charging or internet problems, the doctor may provide services before or after the prescribed time which should be taken as system delay. Regarding payment of doctor's consultation fee:</p>

<p> Since our app is an open medium for doctors and patients, the doctor's fee is completely fixed by the doctor. There is no connection to us. Therefore, the doctor's consultation fee depends entirely on the doctor.  All the doctors who have a consultation fee, their appointment have to be confirmed by paying the consultation fee through the specific payment gateway of the app.  The doctor's consultation fee will not be refunded or refunded in any way to the patient after consulting a doctor directly through video call or messaging or audio call.  If due to any problem or if the doctor is unable to provide the service to the patient and the doctor does not click on the appointment completed option of the app, the consultation fee paid by the patient will be returned or refunded.  Consultation fee will not be refunded in any way after consulting a doctor using the App.  The doctor's consultation fee has to be paid only through the app Payment Gateway and we will not be liable if patient uses any other means.  Any kind of unethical transaction through the app will not be accepted and we will never be responsible for it.</p>
